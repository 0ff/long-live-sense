As Hello said Goodbye, this repo is in an effort to keep the Hardware alive

# Motivation
Hello, inc. yesterday [announced](https://twitter.com/hello/status/874362590045937664) that they'd be shutting down in the foreseeable future.
As a first-minute user of Sense, I'd hate to see this beautiful piece of hardware turn into a beautiful paperweight.

This repository should become a central hub to coordinate the efforts of reverse-engineering the following parts that, in sum, make up Sense.
## Parts 
### Sense Server
#### Sense API
This API is needed to allow for the basic operation of the Sense hardware.

#### App API
This API is consumed by the Sense App and allows reading stats and setting up alarms.
